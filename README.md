This is a Discord bot that parses LaTeX for mathy purposes.

## Setup

Install Node.js. The version doesn't matter. https://nodejs.org/en/

Go to the Discord developer portal, create an app, make it a bot, then add a file named `bot_token.txt` and paste your bot's token into it.

Start the bot with `node .`
